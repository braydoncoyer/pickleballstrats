Hey, I'm Pickleball Strats. An ordinary guy who found Pickleball two years ago and since it has overtaken my life. Pickleball is a brilliant sport; easy to pick up but hard to master. And that's exactly what I've been doing over the last two years -- I've been refining my technique, learning from pros, and competing to take my game to the next level. 

I want to share my experiences with you to help you do the same. On this blog, you'll find advanced pickleball strategy, techniques, and drills for competitive players looking to level up from 3.5 to 4.5+. Master doubles positioning, shot technique, and the mental game with in-depth guides written for serious players.
