## Placeholder Notes

Use `[INTERNAL: topic]` placeholders in article content for:
- Related articles within same pillar
- Cross-pillar connections
- Future articles (to be updated later)

Example in content:
```
The third shot drop is essential, but you also need to understand
[INTERNAL: transition zone positioning] to capitalize on a good drop.
