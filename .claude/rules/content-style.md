# Content Style Rules

These rules apply to ALL content generation in this project. They are non-negotiable.

## Title Rules

### NEVER Do

- **No colons in titles** - Never split titles with colons
  - ❌ "10 Essential Drills: Elevate Your Game"
  - ❌ "Pickleball Strategy: The Ultimate Guide"
  - ❌ "Third Shot Drop: Master This Essential Shot"

- **No clickbait patterns**
  - ❌ "You Won't Believe..."
  - ❌ "The Secret to..."
  - ❌ "What Nobody Tells You About..."
  - ❌ "This One Trick..."

- **No excessive punctuation**
  - ❌ Multiple exclamation points
  - ❌ Question marks in how-to titles
  - ❌ Ellipses for drama

### ALWAYS Do

- **Write compelling, clear titles without colons**
  - ✅ "10 Essential Pickleball Drills for 4.0 Players"
  - ✅ "The Complete Guide to Pickleball Stacking Strategy"
  - ✅ "How to Master the Third Shot Drop in Pickleball"
  - ✅ "Why Your Third Shot Drop Keeps Failing (And How to Fix It)"

- **Include the target keyword naturally**
- **Front-load important words when possible**
- **Keep titles under 60 characters for SEO when possible**

### Alternative Patterns (Instead of Colons)

| Instead of... | Use... |
|---------------|--------|
| "Topic: Subtitle" | "The Complete Guide to Topic" |
| "X Things: Why They Matter" | "X Things Every Player Should Know About..." |
| "Skill: How to Master It" | "How to Master Skill in Pickleball" |
| "Topic: A Deep Dive" | "Everything You Need to Know About Topic" |

## Writing Style Rules

### Paragraph Structure

- Keep paragraphs short: 2-3 sentences maximum
- One idea per paragraph
- Use line breaks liberally for readability

### Sentence Style

- Vary sentence length (mix short and medium)
- Lead with the main point
- Avoid passive voice when possible
- No run-on sentences

### Word Choice

**Avoid these overused phrases:**
- "Game changer"
- "Take your game to the next level"
- "In today's fast-paced world"
- "At the end of the day"
- "It goes without saying"
- "In conclusion"
- "Without further ado"
- "Let's dive in" (at the start)
- "First and foremost"

**Use direct language instead:**
- "This improves..." instead of "This is a game changer for..."
- "Here's how to improve..." instead of "Take your game to the next level by..."
- "In summary" or just start summarizing (no intro needed)

---

## Formatting Rules

### Headings

- H1: Title only (once per article)
- H2: Main sections (5-7 per article)
- H3: Subsections within H2s
- H4: Rarely needed, use sparingly
- No skipping levels (H2 → H4)

### Lists

- Use bullet lists for unordered items
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Keep list items parallel in structure
- Don't overuse lists (not every section needs one)

### Emphasis

- **Bold** for key terms and important points
- *Italics* for emphasis or introducing terms
- Don't overuse either

---

## SEO Rules

### Keyword Usage

- Primary keyword in title (naturally, no forcing)
- Primary keyword in first 100 words
- Primary keyword in at least one H2
- 3-5 total uses throughout (density ~1-2%)
- Related/secondary keywords distributed naturally

### Meta Description

- Under 155 characters
- Include primary keyword
- Compelling and actionable
- No colons or excessive punctuation

---

## Content Quality Rules

### Every Section Must

- Provide specific, actionable value
- Include concrete examples or details
- Build toward helping the reader achieve their goal
- Avoid generic filler content

### Common Mistakes Section

- Include in most how-to articles
- Be specific about what goes wrong
- Explain WHY it's a mistake
- Provide the correct approach

### FAQ Section

- 4-5 real questions users would ask
- Direct, helpful answers
- Not just keyword stuffing
- Can reference earlier content

---

## Internal Linking

- Use `[INTERNAL: topic description]` placeholders
- 3-5 internal links per article
- Link contextually (not "click here")
- How-to articles link UP to pillar
- Pillar articles link DOWN to cluster

---

## Pickleball-Specific Rules

### Terminology

- Use correct pickleball terms (kitchen, not "no-volley zone" every time)
- Skill levels: 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0 (not "beginner/intermediate")
- Be specific about shots, strategies, and techniques

### Audience Assumptions

- Readers know basic rules
- Readers are looking to improve (3.5-5.0 target)
- Readers want actionable advice, not theory
- Respect their time and intelligence

---

## Enforcement

These rules should be:
1. Built into system prompts for AI generation
2. Checked by the review agent
3. Verified before publishing

**If content violates these rules, it should be flagged and rewritten.**
