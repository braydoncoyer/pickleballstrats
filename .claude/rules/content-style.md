# Content Style Rules

These rules apply to ALL content generation in this project. They are non-negotiable.

## Title Rules

### ⛔ ZERO TOLERANCE: NO COLONS IN TITLES ⛔

This is the #1 rule. Any title with a colon will be REJECTED.

- **NEVER use colons in titles** - No exceptions, no "Title: Subtitle" format
  - ❌ REJECTED: "10 Essential Drills: Elevate Your Game"
  - ❌ REJECTED: "Pickleball Strategy: The Ultimate Guide"
  - ❌ REJECTED: "Third Shot Drop: Master This Essential Shot"
  - ❌ REJECTED: "Power vs Control: How to Choose"
  - ❌ REJECTED: "Stacking Strategy: A Complete Guide"

- **No clickbait patterns**
  - ❌ "You Won't Believe..."
  - ❌ "The Secret to..."
  - ❌ "What Nobody Tells You About..."
  - ❌ "This One Trick..."

- **No excessive punctuation**
  - ❌ Multiple exclamation points
  - ❌ Question marks in how-to titles
  - ❌ Ellipses for drama

### ALWAYS Do

- **Write compelling, clear titles without colons**
  - ✅ "10 Essential Pickleball Drills for 4.0 Players"
  - ✅ "The Complete Guide to Pickleball Stacking Strategy"
  - ✅ "How to Master the Third Shot Drop in Pickleball"
  - ✅ "Why Your Third Shot Drop Keeps Failing (And How to Fix It)"

- **Include the target keyword naturally**
- **Front-load important words when possible**
- **Keep titles under 60 characters for SEO when possible**

### Alternative Patterns (Instead of Colons)

| Instead of... | Use... |
|---------------|--------|
| "Topic: Subtitle" | "The Complete Guide to Topic" |
| "X Things: Why They Matter" | "X Things Every Player Should Know About..." |
| "Skill: How to Master It" | "How to Master Skill in Pickleball" |
| "Topic: A Deep Dive" | "Everything You Need to Know About Topic" |

---

## Writing Style Rules

### Paragraph Structure

- Keep paragraphs short: 2-3 sentences maximum
- One idea per paragraph
- Use line breaks liberally for readability

### Sentence Style

- Vary sentence length (mix short and medium)
- Lead with the main point
- Avoid passive voice when possible
- No run-on sentences
- **After 2 medium sentences, add 1 short punch (under 8 words)**
- Use intentional fragments for emphasis: "Worth the practice." "Every time."

### Word Choice

**Avoid these overused phrases:**
- "Game changer"
- "Take your game to the next level"
- "In today's fast-paced world"
- "At the end of the day"
- "It goes without saying"
- "In conclusion"
- "Without further ado"
- "Let's dive in" (at the start)
- "First and foremost"

**Use direct language instead:**
- "This improves..." instead of "This is a game changer for..."
- "Here's how to improve..." instead of "Take your game to the next level by..."
- "In summary" or just start summarizing (no intro needed)

## Humanization Rules (CRITICAL)

These rules make content sound authentically human, not AI-generated.

### AI Phrase Blacklist

**NEVER use these phrases - they are AI tells:**

| AI Phrase | Use Instead |
|-----------|-------------|
| "In this article, we will explore" | Delete entirely, just start with the hook |
| "Let's delve into" | "Let's look at" or just start explaining |
| "It's worth noting that" | Delete, just state the fact |
| "As mentioned earlier" | Reference the specific section |
| "comprehensive guide" | "guide" or "complete guide" |
| "robust solution" | "solid approach" or just "solution" |
| "leverage" | "use" |
| "utilize" | "use" |
| "facilitate" | "help" |
| "cutting-edge" | "latest" or "new" |
| "game-changing" | Describe the specific impact |
| "ever-evolving" | "changing" or be specific about what changed |
| "synergy" | Describe the actual benefit |
| "empower" | "help" or "enable" |
| "dive deep" | "look at" or "explore" |
| "unpack" | "explain" or "break down" |
| "landscape" | Be specific about the context |
| "paradigm" | Avoid entirely |
| "holistic" | "complete" or "full" |
| "streamline" | "simplify" or "speed up" |
| "optimize" | "improve" |
| "innovative" | Be specific about what's new |
| "seamless" | "smooth" or describe the experience |
| "groundbreaking" | Be specific about the breakthrough |

### Sentence Variety Rules

**The rhythm that sounds human:**
1. Medium sentence (10-20 words)
2. Medium sentence (10-20 words)
3. Short punch (under 8 words)

**Example flow:**
- "The third shot drop is essential for advancing to the kitchen. Most players struggle because they hit it too hard. Short swing. That's the fix."

**Intentional fragments to use:**
- "Worth the practice."
- "Every time."
- "No exceptions."
- "Simple as that."
- "That's it."
- "Game over."
- "Trust me on this."

### Personal Perspective Injection

**Required in every article:**
- One "In my experience..." or "What I've found..."
- One "we call this..." when introducing terminology
- One acknowledgment of difficulty: "This is tricky at first" or "one of the harder skills"

### Specific Details Over Generic

| ❌ Generic | ✅ Specific |
|------------|-------------|
| "Move quickly to the ball" | "Take 2-3 shuffle steps, keeping your paddle at chest height" |
| "Practice regularly" | "Spend 15 minutes before each session on this drill" |
| "Get in position early" | "Split step 0.5 seconds before your opponent contacts the ball" |
| "Most players struggle" | "67% of 3.5 players miss this shot" |
| "Practice a lot" | "3-4 sessions per week, 20 minutes each" |

### Number Specificity

**Use odd/specific numbers, avoid round numbers:**
- ✅ 67% not 70%
- ✅ 3-4 times not 5 times
- ✅ 2.3 seconds not 2 seconds
- ✅ 0.5 seconds not half a second
- ✅ 3.7 rating not 4.0 rating (when discussing skill levels generally)

### Sample Phrases to Use

These match Braydon's actual writing voice:
- "at its core"
- "Whether you're [X] or [Y]"
- "we call this"
- "one of the hardest parts"
- "here's the thing"
- "Let's break this down"
- "Here's what separates 3.5 players from 4.0+"
- "This is where most players go wrong"
