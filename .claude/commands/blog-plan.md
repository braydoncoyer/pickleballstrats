# Weekly Content Planning

Plan content topics for the upcoming 7 days following the pillar/cluster strategy.

## Content Mix Per Day

- **8 How-To articles** (80%): Practical, actionable guides (1500-2000 words)
- **1 Pillar article** (10%): Comprehensive guides (3000-5000 words)
- **1 Comparison article** (10%): X vs Y analyses (2000-2500 words)

## Process

1. **Review Content Pillars**
   - Load all active content pillars from Sanity
   - Check current topic queue for each pillar
   - Identify pillars needing new topics

2. **Generate Topic Ideas**
   - For each pillar with low queue, generate 10+ new topic ideas
   - Focus on long-tail keywords with search intent
   - Validate topics against safety rules
   - Assign priority scores based on SEO potential

3. **Create Weekly Schedule**
   - Distribute topics across pillars (round-robin)
   - Ensure mix of article types each day
   - Schedule pillar articles for optimal publishing times
   - Save schedule to Sanity CMS

4. **Output Weekly Plan**
   - Day-by-day breakdown with topics
   - Pillar assignments
   - Target keywords for each article
   - Estimated total word count
   - Projected AI costs

## Topic Selection Criteria

Good topics should:
- Target specific, searchable queries
- Have clear user intent
- Avoid blocked categories (health, finance, legal)
- Fit within content pillar themes
- Support internal linking strategy
